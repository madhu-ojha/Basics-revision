## Introduction

Python is a widely-used, high-level programming language known for its readability and versatility. This repository aims to cover essential Python concepts, including data types, control flow, functions, and more. Additionally, it provides examples of basic operations and simple programming tasks to help you get started with practical applications.

## Python Basics

### Data Types
- Numbers: integers, floating-point numbers
- Strings: text data
- Lists: ordered collections
- Tuples: immutable collections
- Dictionaries: key-value pairs

### Control Flow
- Conditional statements: `if`, `elif`, `else`
- Loops: `for` loops, `while` loops
- Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`

### Functions
- Defining functions
- Function parameters and return values
- Lambda functions

## Operations

### Arithmetic Operations
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Modulus, exponentiation

### String Operations
- Concatenation
- String methods: `split()`, `join()`, `replace()`

### List Operations
- Adding elements: `append()`, `insert()`
- Removing elements: `remove()`, `pop()`
- List comprehension

## Simple Programming Tasks

### Armstrong Numbers
- Check whether a number is an Armstrong number.

### Getter/Setter Methods
- Implement getter and setter methods for a class attribute.

### Fibonacci Sequence
- Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.

### OTP Generation
- Generate a One-Time Password (OTP) for authentication purposes.
